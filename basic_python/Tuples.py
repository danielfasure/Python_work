"""
tuples
Key characteristics
- Ordered: The items in a tuple maintain their position.
- Immutable: Once created, you cannot change, add, or remove elements.
- Heterogeneous: They can hold different data types (strings, numbers, objects, etc.).
- Indexed: You access elements by their position (starting at 0).
